## Usage:
1. Clone or download the repository, then open the provided Jupyter Notebook to follow the step-by-step instructions.
2. Change the path for your input FASTQ files.
3. Run each step you need for your analysis to have a clean dataset.
4. Run the enrichment section on the cleaned data.

This code is developed in [The Denard lab](https://www.thedenardlab.com/).


## Requirements:
python 3.12.3
biopython 1.83
numpy 1.26.4
pandas 2.1.1
scipy 1.11.3
seaborn 0.12.2

For ESM-2 embedding you need to install transformers in your virtual environment(suggested way):

```
conda install conda-forge::transformers
```
You also need to install UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction.
```
 conda install conda-forge::umap-learn
```

This work uses ESM [^1], UMAP [^2], and BioPython [^3], please make sure to cite them.
